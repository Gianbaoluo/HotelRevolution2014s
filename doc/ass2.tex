\section{Assignment 2}

\subsection{The Task to be Undertaken}
Our project aims to help hotel receptionists in their work, making easier and quicker for them to book rooms for the hotel's guests. The software will allow them to book a rooms in few clicks, to find out precisely and immediately which rooms are free and for how many days, the general availability of rooms in a certain period, the features of every room and so on. It will also help the hotel owner while billing the clients, calculating automatically the price of the stay and the total revenue of the hotel in a certain period.

We will develop our software on three sides: realizing a database containing the information about hotel's rooms and their availability, designing a graphical interface that will be user-friendly to minimize the training period of the staff and allow them to be comfortable with our software, and developing a software that will hold database's informations for the staff and help the owner to bill clients and to calculate the revenue of his hotel.




\subsection{suggested deliverables}
Not being expert on the main procedures about hotel’s organization, we believe that to realize this project a continuos and total collaboration among System Analysts, System Designers, System Developers and Final Users is crucial.


Management deliverables

Requirement Analysis 
	
	Our intention is to organize many meetings and a documentation about Requirement Analysis in way such to be sure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item to have a complete acquaintance of clients’ necessity and expectations
	\item to improve the communication and cooperation level among developers,
	  designers, managers and users
	\item to give Final User the possibility to have a central role during the entire 
	  developing of the system and to choose, from time to time, the best solution
\end{enumerate}

Design Document
	
	We want to document and to maintain the presence of Final Users even in the design process of the system. By doing so, and by keeping in mind the Requirement Analysis, we want to come encounter to Final Users’ necessities. 
	These documents will be held in refresh for all the Design process’ duration.


Source Code
		
	Our intention is to document all the development of the code, not only at a technical level, comprehensible only to the programmers, but even at a more user friendly level. So, even Final Users will be able to keep under control the development of the system.

	








Technical deliverables

DataBase 
		
	We are going to use a Database Structure, divided in tables, to save the different informations like:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item rooms’ booking 
	\item payments
	\item general services 
	\item others
\end{enumerate}

Interface  
	
	We will organize the system as mush user friendly as possible. We will implement the main functionalities directly on the home page. These are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item to add / cancel a reservation
	\item to verify the availability of a room and its position inside the hotel
	\item to verify payments
	\item to control general services
\end{enumerate}

 
	- interactive Structure of the Hotel 
	
	According to clients’ necessity we will implement, on the home page, an interactive structure that represents the hotel. By doing so, Final user will immediately have a complete view of general situation, and the possibility to select a room to know its details.
