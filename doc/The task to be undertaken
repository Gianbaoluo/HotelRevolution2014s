Our project aims to help hotel receptionists in their work, making easier and quicker for them to book rooms for the hotel's guests. The software will allow them to book a rooms in few clicks, to find out precisely and immediately which rooms are free and for how many days, the general availiability of rooms in a certain period, the features of every room and so on. It will also help the hotel owner while billing the clients, calculating automatically the price of the stay and the total revenue of the hotel in a certain period.

We will develop our software on three sides: realizing a database containing the information about hotel's rooms and their availiability, designing a graphical interface that will be user-friendly to minimize the training period of the staff and allow them to be comfortable with our software, and developing a software that will hold database's informations for the staff and help the owner to bill clients and to calculate the revenue of his hotel.
